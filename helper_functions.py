""" Verde Voyage: ALL computation and helper fucntions for a green flight path result

Module Descriptions
==================
This module is designed as the core of the computation and the behind the scences of our VerdeVoyage platform.
In this module, we create functions that provide a flight score based on given parameters, return optimal flight routes,
create various graphs, provide educational tips, and further includes our run_voyage()
function that takes the user through a vacation planning journey.
